# Bookmark Manager

Build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

## The project

Build a bookmark manager.  A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

## How to use the program
### Cloning the repo & installing the necessary gems
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:stringiest/bookmark_manager.git
$ cd bookmark_manager
$ bundle
```
### Creating the database
1. Connect to `psql`
2. Create the database using the `psql` command `CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;`
3. Connect to the database using the `psql` command `\c bookmark_manager;`
4. Run the query we have saved in the file `01_create_bookmarks_table.sql`
5. Run the query we have saved in the file `02_add_title_to_bookmarks.sql`

### Setting up the test database
1. Connect to `psql`
2. Create the database using the `psql` command `CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager_test;`
3. Connect to the database using the `psql` command `\c bookmark_manager_test;`
4. Run the query we have saved in the file `01_create_bookmarks_table.sql`
5. Run the query we have saved in the file `02_add_title_to_bookmarks.sql`

### To run the Bookmark Manager app:
```
rackup -p 3000
```
